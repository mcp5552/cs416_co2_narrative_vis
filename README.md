# CS416 Narrative Visualization Project: <br> *CO₂ Emissions: How Did We Get Here?*


An interactive narrative visualization exploring the history of global CO₂ emissions.

The data for this project comes from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions), which compiles comprehensive historical and contemporary metrics on global CO₂ and greenhouse gas emissions. The dataset includes national and global figures for total emissions, per capita emissions, emissions by fuel type (coal, oil, gas, etc.), GDP, and population from as early as 1750. It enables comparisons across countries and over time, and supports analysis of both environmental impact and economic context.
